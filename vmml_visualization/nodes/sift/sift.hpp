    number of octaves is computed automatically from the image resolution.

    @param contrastThreshold The contrast threshold used to filter out weak features in semi-uniform
    (low-contrast) regions. The larger the threshold, the less features are produced by the detector.

    @param edgeThreshold The threshold used to filter out edge-like features. Note that the its meaning
    is different from the contrastThreshold, i.e. the larger the edgeThreshold, the less features are
    filtered out (more features are retained).

    @param sigma The sigma of the Gaussian applied to the input image at the octave \#0. If your image
    is captured with a weak camera with soft lenses, you might want to reduce the number.
